# Face Mask Detection

Face Mask Detection is a computer vision project aimed at detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This project utilizes deep learning techniques and a dataset of images to train a model that can classify images into two classes: 'with_mask' and 'without_mask'. The detection of face masks can be useful in various scenarios, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure safety and compliance with mask-wearing guidelines.


# Motivation
Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task cumbersome and challenging.
